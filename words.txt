There
was
a
man
called
Bob.
Bob
is
an
ordinary
man.
Till
he
saw
a
pokemon
named
Pikachu.
He
captured
it.
THE
END.
Once
upon
a
time,
there
was
a
girl
called
and
a
boy
called
and
a
dude
called
and,
not
to
forget,
a
man
named
of
course.
They
were
happy
men.
But
the
ghosts
in
the
town
were
not.
They
hated
them,
and
they
wanted
to
kill
all
the
people
in
the
tavern.
The
people
of
the
tavern
did
not
like
that,
so
they
went
to
the
Mayor
who,
naturally,
did
not
like
that
either.
The
Reporter
and
the
Guardian
wanted
to
help
him,
but
the
ghosts
were
cows.
Sometimes,
they
eat
ectoplasm
and
eggs
and
furnaces,
so
the
vampire
and
the
witch
attempted
to
stop
the
cult
leader
and
a
member
who
were
helping
the
ghosts.
The
story
already
did
not
make
much
sense,
but
it
gets
worse.
The
crowd
seeker
is
looking
for
the
fortune
teller
who
was
eating
a
pizza
while
the
warlock
and
the
werewolves
were
walking
on
the
street
with
the
macho
and
the
executioner.
This
was
unfair.
This
was
not
fair.
No,
in
contrary.
On
the
other
hand,
the
man
who
was
in
love
with
the
woman.
Although
she
was
the
cupid,
they
loved
each
other
more
than
pickles
do.
The
story
got
worse,
because
the
flute
player
was
dead
and
nobody
knew
that.
So
as
the
story
went
on,
someone
was
looking
for
a
giant
killing
spree
while
the
lynching
on
the
town
square
was
killing
us.
The
ghosts
wanted
revenge,
so
@everyone
asked
for
a
beer
and
a
wine
of
course.
Who
knew
that?
Over
@here
they
claimed
they
were
innocent,
but
they
lied
and
secretly
were
the
white
werewolf
and
the
lone
wolf
simultaneously.
That
did
not
make
sense,
so
the
others
never
suspected
him.
Once
upon
a
time
there
was
an
octopu
And
the
octopus

So,
One
day
Brian
the
octopus
went
onto
the
land
and
out
of
the

What
Brian

so
extraordinary
that
he
ate
eggs
instead
of
laying

Every
time
he
ate
an
egg
he
said
dynamic

as
if
that
meant
so
much
to
him.
It
obviously
did
not
make
sense,
but
for
the
chicken,
it
made
perfect
sense.
Nobody

But
then
this
chicken
was
cornered
by
a
human

and
the
chicken
could
not

due
to
the
inability
of
being
able
to
say
some
words
in
the
English
language
apart
from

Then
the
human
decided
to
be
thoughtless
and
to
start
stalking
the
chicken.
He
examined
every
move
of
the
unaware
chicken,
and
then
he
saw
the
egg-eating
fetish
from
the
chicken.
The
human
tried
to
comprehend
but
had
failed
miserably.
The
end.
In
a
galaxy
far,
far
away...
There
was
a
small
village
on
a
planet
called
Earth.
This
village
was
full
of
both
good
and
bad
people.
One
day
an
evil
curse
was
cast
upon
the
village.
A
thick
fog
rolled
in
from
the
east
and
blanketed
the
village
making
it
impossible
to
leave.
The
townspeople
soon
noticed
a
change
in
those
around
them.
On
the
first
night
a
man
was
murdered
and
left
in
the
streets
for
the
entire
town
to
see.
After
this,
suspects
began
to
arise,
pacts
were
made,
and
rumours
were
spread
all
about
town.
The
local
tavern
became
a
place
of
exile
for
those
with
worried
minds.
Alcohol
became
an
escape,
but
in
the
towns
inebriated
state
mistakes
were
made.
Innocents
were
hung
for
their
mysterious
ways.
The
werewolves,
the
cursed,
and
the
undead
grew
in
numbers
every
day.
Soon,
those
who
were
not
trusted
before,
such
as
the
cult,
were
now
the
most
reliable
members
of
the
community.
However,
even
they
eventually
were
infiltrated.
In
the
end,
the
town
was
able
to
rid
itself
of
the
curse.
Only
after
more
than
half
of
the
original
population
was
killed,
either
by
assassination,
werewolves,
lynching,
or
through
the
love
they
had
for
another.
This
is
the
story
of
Evils
End.
A
town
cursed,
but
not
lost.
The
first
known
recorded
instance
of
werewolf
attacks
was
in
TumbleTow
It
has
been
claimed
that
other
attacks
predate
this
town.
There
was
a
massive
library
that
contained
this
knowledge.
Unfortunately,
it
was
destroyed
by
the
evil
creatures.
The
citizens
of
Tumble
Town
fought
a
good
battle.
They
happened
to
have
a
Fortune
Teller,
a
Huntress,
and
the
Bakers
Guild
to
help
fight
the
wolves.
But
alas,
one
of
the
townsfolk
was
in
love
with
one
of
the
wolves.
This
relationship
led
to
the
town
destroying
itself
and,
in
the
end,
there
was
a
single
wolf
that
survived.
This
lone
wolf
had
to
pause
his
plans
of
attacking
the
next
village.
After
seeing
what
such
a
small
town
could
do,
he
decided
to
silently
build
up
a
new
army
before
moving
on.
After
many
years,
he
had
rebuilt
his
wolf
pack.
He
also
managed
to
find
a
warlock
to
join
his
escapade.
Once
he
thought
his
group
was
ready,
they
set
their
sights
for
Verdict
Village!
But,
the
werewolves
were
not
the
only
ones
preparing
for
a
fight.
After
hearing
about
the
destruction
of
Tumble
Town,
Verdict
Village
thought
it
wise
to
prepare
themselves.
They
trained
villagers
how
to
escape
an
attack,
who
became
known
as
Runners.
They
also
managed
to
find
a
crowd
seeker
to
help
them,
as
well
as
a
small
cult
group.
This
gave
them
a
small
advantage
over
the
foul
beasts.
But
neither
side
had
planned
for
the
Flute
Player.
This
guy
came
strolling
into
town
with
the
intent
of
enchanting
the
villagers
for
his
own
personal
use.
Little
did
he
know
a
war
was
about
to
break
out.
Once
it
did,
he
thought
the
chaos
would
be
to
his
benefit.
He
could
even
enchant
a
few
wolves
while
he
was
at
it.
Yes,
that
would
be
a
great
success!
He
enchanted
a
few
people,
but
was
eventually
killed
in
the
crossfire.
In
the
end,
Verdict
Village
successfully
defeated
the
werewolf
threat.
The
talks
eventually
made
it
to
neighboring
villages
and
eventually
the
news
was
spread
across
the
land.
Unfortunately,
not
all
ears
that
heard
the
news
belonged
to
righteous
people.

Soon,
other
evil
creatures
heard
the
news.
For
some
unknown
reason,
this
drew
their
attention
to
a
town
called
Evils
End!
In
addition
to
the
creatures
already
named,
there
was
a
Tanner,
Infected
Wolf,
and
a
Lone
Wolf
who
came
to
fight
as
well.
Evils
End
had
also
gathered
a
Barber,
Executioner,
and
a
Royal
Knight
as
backup
in
the
upcoming
battle.
Although
both
sides
were
prepared
for
the
Flute
Player,
the
rumors
had
also
grabbed
the
attention
of
a
Vampire!
This
creature
kept
to
the
shadows
and
built
up
her
undead
army.
A
wise
strategy
of
gaining
power
while
the
other
two
groups
killed
each
other
off.
But
once
her
presence
became
known,
she
was
added
to
the
target
list.
It
took
some
doing,
but
Evil
End
finally
managed
to
fight
off
both
the
werewolves
and
the
undead
army.
It
seems
the
world
is
safe
for
now,
but
every
village
knows
to
be
prepared.
Nobody
knows
when
or
where
the
next
attack
may
come
from.
They
just
know
to
be
prepared.
No
doubt
that
the
evil
beasts
already
have
their
next
target
in
mindâ¦
Did
you
ever
hear
the
tragedy
of
Darth
Plagueis
The
Wise?
I
thought
not.
Itâs
not
a
story
the
Jedi
would
tell
you.
Itâs
a
Sith
legend.
Darth
Plagueis
was
a
Dark
Lord
of
the
Sith,
so
powerful
and
so
wise
he
could
use
the
Force
to
influence
the
midichlorians
to
create
life
He
had
such
a
knowledge
of
the
dark
side
that
he
could
even
keep
the
ones
he
cared
about
from
dying.
The
dark
side
of
the
Force
is
a
pathway
to
many
abilities
some
consider
to
be
unnatural.
He
became
so
powerfulâ¦
the
only
thing
he
was
afraid
of
was
losing
his
power,
which
eventually,
of
course,
he
did.
Unfortunately,
he
taught
his
apprentice
everything
he
knew,
then
his
apprentice
killed
him
in
his
sleep.
Ironic.
He
could
save
others
from
death,
but
not
himself.
